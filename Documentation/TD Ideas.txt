TD Ideas
--------

Platform
+ Nintendo Switch seems like a good system because of the apparent focus on local multi-player

Coop
+ the game should be able to be played together or alone
+ a new player should be able to play with a much more skilled player and still feel useful
+ new players shouldn't be a burden to skilled players, but always able to help somehow
+ coop mode should take advantage of any peculiarities of Nintendo Switch if possible (and relevant)
+ there should be interactions that help players feel connected and want to work together
  - tasks that require players to do things independently, then come together to finish (see overcooked)
  - tasks that require constant cooperation from start to finish
  - tasks where players feel connected by some easy and loose action that requires no skill (see tower levelling in monsters)
  - tasks where players feel their independent action caused success or failure for the team

Gameplay
+ could be simple defense game where you protect your base
+ could be attack style game where you push forward to destroy an opponent before they become too powerful
+ could have minions that are not under the player's direct control
  - resource gatherers
  - attackers (instead of towers)
  - builders (build the towers for you, but can get killed by monsters)
+ How do monsters move?
  - monsters could be glued to paths
  - or follow paths loosely with some physical properties to allow them to be knocked around and slowed down
  - they could follow the shape of the terrain (3d terrain?)
  - or just flow in the shortest path toward their target (player base, presumably)
+ What movement types would monsters have?
  - walking
  - flying
  - tunneling (need specific weapons to unearth them)
  - swimming (need underwater towers to hurt them)
+ How are towers placed?
  - can only build in designated spots (trees in monsters)
  - can build almost anywhere (grid in many flash td)
  - can build anywhere (free placement with perhaps simple tower to tower collision constraints)
  - there are no towers, just minions
  - players can carry towers around? break apart and move?


World + Theme

Customisation + Editor
+ very simple customisation of player characters through colour and some attachments such as replacement heads, hats etc.
+ a flag that the player can customise with a very simple editor
+ would love to have an in-game editor that can save and load custom levels
+ can build levels easily using a gamepad (or touch screen)
+ can switch theme by hitting a theme button (might require tweaking, but themes should be interchangeable)
