I would like to serialize LevelData into a simple json format that can be easily read, and modified by hand.
This document contains snippets of how the LevelData object should be stored. Note that Unity's json doesn't
support dictionaries, so I'm trying to keep everything in simple object or array formats.

Using json also means that I should be able to do small naming changes easily using a text editor, where a
binary format would just break.

{
  // level data / header info
  "levelInfo": {},
  "paths": [],
  "waves": [],
  // objects (note that objects are used in different ways, some might be deco, others important gameplay items, so maybe this should be broken up?)
  "objects": [],
}


{
  "id": "level1",
  "level_details": {

    "info": "big invasion from 3 sides",
  },
  "paths": [
    {
      "points": [
        {0.5, 0, 5},
        {2, 0, 5},
        {3, 0, 6},
      ],
      "tension": -0.5,
    },
    {

    },
  ],
  "waves": [
  
  ],
  "objects": [
    {
      "prefab": "TREE_GREEN_1"
      "position": {0, 0, 0},
      "rotation": {0, 54, 0},
      "scale": {1, 1, 1}
    }
  ],
  
}
